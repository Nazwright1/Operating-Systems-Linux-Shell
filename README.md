This is the Aggie Shell:

What is a shell? 
  A shell is a program that fetches and interprets text commands from the user. Many of these commands create new processes to run some particular part of the overall operation and communicate the information back to a parent process, displaying the overall output of the text command input by the user.

What is a process? 
  A process is any program that is currently in execution. Therefore, Linux commands are just programs(executable files) that can be triggered by text commands from the user.
